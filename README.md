## Motivation

The problem with classical Pomodoro is that we often finish our work early or the task takes longer than 25 minutes, resulting in interruptions by the alarm.

Flowmo addresses this by offering flexibility: **work x minutes, take x/5 minutes break**. Flowmo automatically calculate and set break timer for you based on your work duration. In this way you can stay in the flow state while maintaining the 5:1 work-break ratio.

## Features

- **🕒 Flexible Timer**: Work 50 minutes, take 10 minutes break; work 120 minutes, take 24 minutes break.
- **📋 Todo List**: Select a task when focus to stay monotasked. Todoist integration available.
- **📊 Focus Report**: Provide daily / weekly / yearly stats for enhanced productivity insights.
- **⚙️ Customizable Options**: Tweak the work and break ratio to fit your needs.
